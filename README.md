# Predictive-Analytics-for-Pakistan-s-E-Commerce-Sector

This project explores Pakistan's largest e-commerce dataset using data analytics and machine learning techniques.
We aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and actionable insights from over 1 million transaction records to better understand the dynamics of Pakistan’s growing online retail sector.

Key Highlights:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier removal, normalization, and encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and trend analysis

Machine Learning Models:

Regression (Linear, Random Forest, Polynomial, Gradient Boosting)

Classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Multi-Layer Perceptron)

Clustering Analysis: K-Means for customer segmentation

Model Evaluation: MSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Explainable AI: Using LIME and SHAP to interpret model decisions

Predicting transaction "status" based on pricing, discounts, and other features

Tech Stack:
Python • Pandas • Scikit-learn • Matplotlib • Seaborn • SHAP • LIME
